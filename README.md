### </> Description: </br>
The forEach method is also used to loop through arrays, but it uses a function differently than the classic "for loop".</br>

The forEach method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the following parameters:</br>

Current Value (required) - The value of the current array element</br>
Index (optional) - The current element's index number</br>
Array (optional) - The array object to which the current element belongs</br>
